## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


#### add
```
To prepare a file ready to be committed to the Git repository.
```

#### branch
```
check to see the current branch you are working on; it will also list all the branches you are working on.
```

#### checkout
```
By default, Git repositories are set to the master branch. Git checkout used with the -b option creates a new branch, and switch to it at the same time.
```

#### clone
```
clones the contents of the Git repository to your local machine
```

#### commit
```
Records the changes "officially" as far as Git is concerned.
```

#### fetch
```
fetch is similar to pull but fetch doesn't do any merging like pull does.
```

#### log
```
see the changes we've committed so far, in the order we committed them.
```

#### merge
```
To add the changes from the new branch to master 
```

#### pull
```
if we collaborate with others on our project, they can pull our changes, commit changes, and push the
changes back to the git repo. We can pull down any new changes by using 'git pull'
```

#### push
```
pushes local changes to our origin repository on Github
```

#### reset
```
Unstage files
```

#### rm
```
Removes the file indicated from the disk and stage the removal for us.
```

#### status
```
check the status of the Git repository
```

## Release 4: Git Workflow

- Push files to a remote repository
- Fetch changes
- Commit locally

## Release 5: Reflection

```
My understanding of git pull and git fetch is still shady and would like to read more about the same.
```
